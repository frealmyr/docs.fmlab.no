Welcome to my blog! ðŸ™Œ

Here i will post tutorials, tips and tricks for homelabs and cloud infrastructure whenever i feel a writer's itch.

This whole page is hosted in github pages, with github actions automagically building and deploying the markdown files to a dedicated branch for hosting.

This entire site is [publicly available here.](https://github.com/frealmyr/fmlab.no/)
