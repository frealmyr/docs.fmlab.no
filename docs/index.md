Welcome to my blog! ðŸ™Œ

Here i will post tutorials, tips and tricks for homelabs and cloud infrastructure whenever i feel a writer's itch.

This whole page is hosted by github pages, with a github action that automagically builds and deploys this site to a dedicated branch when i push changes to the master branch.

This entire site is [publicly available here.](https://github.com/frealmyr/fmlab.no/)
